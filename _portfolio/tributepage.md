I've been learning by my own in [www.freecodecamp.com](www.freecodecamp.com).
I really appreciate that kind of websites even tough it's free, it's good quality study material and challenges.

By far I've just completed the first challenge of the item called Basic Front End Development Projects

See the live demo and code at:

The project was build using
<ul>
  <li>HTML</li>
  <li>CSS</li>
  <li>Bootstrap</li>
</ul>
