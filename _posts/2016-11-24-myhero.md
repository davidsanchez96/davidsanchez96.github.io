The main focus of this post is to talk about my personal hero.
All of us has different definitions of what a hero is, I'll tell you what a hero means for me
Firstly, My Personal must meet some requirements, so I'll tell you.

The first requirement is 'The person doesn't expect anything in return', because some times we really don't appreciate that kind of simple things, we can observe that kind of heroic facts by simple, think up you are walking to wait the bus and the bus came and you were far from it, but you raised your hand and fortunately the bus driver saw you trying to catch the bus and he decided to wait for you, then the bus driver become a hero for you only for that day because he did that without expecting anything in return, that quality is a very valuable thing these days.
